This project is an internet movie database responsive application, which contains a small movie database example dataset, that allows users to find basic information about movies such as casting, ratings, directors etc. Users can reach all kind of movies, by default, or a specific genre such as action, adventure, animation, comedy, crime, documentary, drama, family, fantasy, foreign, history, horror, music, mystery, romance, science fiction, thriller, tv-movies, war and western. A registered user can also rate a movie, or leave a review/comment, or both. DuckFlix provides the ability to find interesting movies easier and quicker than other popular websites.


Specifically: 

•	Users can search movies by typing in the key word of a movie or by typing in the movie's name

•	Users can search movies by choosing only the specific genre (just click enter button on the search bar)

•	Users can be informed about popular movies, on five different popular categories (sliders)

•	Users will be allowed to leave reviews/comments

The main purpose of this project is educational and for that the implementation is simple and minimal. It is worth noting that not many features were implemented, in order for the specific project to fulfill its educational purpose and to give time to all team members to work collaboratively, but also as a team for the benefit of the project.

Developed by a team of five students as part of the Software Engineering for Web Applications course of the International Hellenic University.

We took inspiration from others Movie Database Projects, in order  to decide upon what features and layout our web application might have, BUT we didn`t copy any of them.
